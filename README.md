# BIO465ModelTraining
Images and code necessary to train model


To create the training models, use the following command:
```bash generate_caffe_models.sh```

This is only necessary if you want to use models other than the ones provided
by the prediction [repository](https://github.com/EPortela2013/BIO465LeafPrediction "BIO465LeafPrediction").
